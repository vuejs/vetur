# VTI

🚧This feature is not stable yet.🚧

VTI (Vetur Terminal Interface) is a CLI that exposes some of Vetur's features.

![VTI demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4033249/72225084-911ef580-3581-11ea-9943-e7165126ace9.gif).

Currently, this is only used for generating interpolation type-checking errors on CLI, which
neither Vue's compiler nor Webpack would catch.

Please send feedback to: https://github.com/vuejs/vetur/issues/1635.
